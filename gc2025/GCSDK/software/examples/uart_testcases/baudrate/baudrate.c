/* Procedure
Set up Stop bits -1, No parity for both UARTs
UART0 Miniterm - change the baud rate as required
UART1 Miniterm baud rate is set as 19200 
Connection Details:
Take a UART Module and connect the TX to RX of other module and vice versa
Run the code and type in the UART1 Miniterm window
The typed char will be displayed in the UART0 Miniterm window along with "The received char: "
*/
