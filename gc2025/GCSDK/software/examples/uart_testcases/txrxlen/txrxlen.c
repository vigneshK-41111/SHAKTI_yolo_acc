/*Connection Details:
Take a UART Module and connect the TX to RX of other module and vice versa
Configure UART1 (cutecom) and UART0 (miniterm) with same baudrate, no of bits & Stop bits to be transmitted and parity.
Run the code and type in the UART1  window
Continuously send some char from cutecom (UART1) to UART0
UART0 is expecting 2 Stop bits where as UART1 is Sending data with 1 stop bit.
We will get an framing error bit set.*/
