/*
Connection Details:
Take a UART Module and connect the TX to RX of other module and vice versa
Run the code and type in the UART1 Miniterm window
UART0: 19200, No parity; (miniterm)
UART1: 19200, stop bit=2 No parity; (cutecom)
Try sending chars from UART1 to UART0

UART 0 is expecting 2 stop bits whereas UART1 sends char with 1 stop bit, so frame error occurs*/
