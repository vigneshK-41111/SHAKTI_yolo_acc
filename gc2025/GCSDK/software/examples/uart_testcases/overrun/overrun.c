/*
Connection Details:
Take a UART Module and connect the TX to RX of other module and vice versa
Run the code and type in the UART1 Miniterm window
UART0: 19200, stop bit=1 No parity; (miniterm)
UART1: 19200, stop bit=1 No parity; (cutecom)
Try sending chars from UART1 to UART0 it will reflect overrun error in UART0.
