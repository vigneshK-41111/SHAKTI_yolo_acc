 * @brief A passive buzzer (AKA magnetic transducer) can make different tones,
 * but the devices that controls the buzzer has to provide it with an oscillating
 * electronic signal at a desired frequency. The supplied frequency will determine 
 * the tone. Supplying just a fixed voltage will generate no sound, except perhaps
 * a slight "tick" at the point when the power source is connected or disconnected from the buzzer.
